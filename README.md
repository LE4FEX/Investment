Interactive single-page web app for tracking and analysing investments with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for easy deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages/Netlify) without a backend.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not financial advice** ‚Äî this project is for educational and back-testing purposes only. Always perform your own due diligence before making investment decisions.

> üîê **Privacy note** ‚Äî portfolio data, settings, and alerts are stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`). Use **Settings ‚Üí Reset App** to clear all stored information or manually clear the site data in your browser.

## Features

- **Portfolio Tracker** ‚Äì record holdings, auto-compute cost basis, market value, and real-time P/L with live (Alpha Vantage) or mock data.
- **Quotes & Watchlist** ‚Äì fetch the latest price, day change, and draw price history charts (with SMA20/50 overlays) for saved tickers.
- **Technical Analysis** ‚Äì compute SMA/EMA, RSI, MACD, and highlight recent crossover signals with interactive charts.
- **Backtesting** ‚Äì run SMA crossover simulations versus buy-and-hold, view equity curves, return/CAGR, and trade stats.
- **DCA Simulator** ‚Äì model monthly dollar-cost averaging, tracking invested capital, units accumulated, and value over time.
- **Alerts** ‚Äì store RSI high/low thresholds and show which symbols are currently oversold or overbought.
- **Settings & Controls** ‚Äì quick header toggles for currency and language (English/‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢), an API status indicator, and a settings pane to save the Alpha Vantage key, pick a default symbol, toggle the Netlify proxy, and reset the workspace.
- **Mobile-friendly UI** ‚Äì responsive layout, high-contrast theme, keyboard focus states, and zoomable charts tuned for mobile & tablet usage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install dependencies and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. (Optional) Grab a free [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key) API key and store it under **Settings** ‚Üí **Alpha Vantage API Key** (or add it to `env.js`).
4. Start adding tickers in the Portfolio or Watchlist. The Technicals, Backtest, DCA, and Alerts panes auto-load using the saved default symbol.

Without an API key, the app automatically falls back to deterministic mock market data so every feature remains usable offline (the header badge switches to _API: Mock data_).

### Internationalisation, Currency & Status

- Use the header toggles to switch between **English** and **Thai** or change the display currency (USD, THB, EUR, JPY); the interface updates instantly without a reload.
- The header status badge shows whether live Alpha Vantage data is being used (_API: Live_), mocked (_API: Mock data_), or if there was an error.
- Optional runtime configuration: add an `env.js` file (ignored by git) such as:

  ```js
  window.__ENV__ = {
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY: 'your-key',
    USE_NETLIFY_PROXY: false,
  };
  ```

  This keeps secrets out of source control while letting the app pick them up automatically at runtime.

## Development

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build      # production build in dist/
npm run lint       # eslint (flat config) across src/
npm run format     # prettier --write .
npm run test       # vitest unit tests
```

Pre-commit hooks (Husky + lint-staged) run ESLint/Prettier on staged files before every commit.

## Live Demo

- **Production**: _(Update with the deployed URL once available)_
- **Latest build**: Use `npm run build` to generate a production bundle in `dist/`, ready for GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.

Badges at the top of this README will automatically reflect CI/build status once the deployment workflow is configured with the final repository owner and URL.

Add real screenshots or GIFs to the [`docs/screenshots/`](docs/screenshots/) folder and update the table below.

| View               | Description                              | File                               |

| Dashboard          | Portfolio overview with summary cards    | `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png`   |
| Technical Analysis | Indicator overlays with zoom controls    | `docs/screenshots/technicals.png`  |
| Backtest           | SMA crossover equity curve vs buy & hold | `docs/screenshots/backtest.png`    |
| Settings (TH)      | Thai localisation with API status badge  | `docs/screenshots/settings-th.png` |

## Deployment

Because everything runs client-side, you can host the `/` directory on any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

### Netlify setup

1. `netlify.toml` is preconfigured (`publish = .`) with functions stored in `netlify/functions`.
2. Add `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Netlify UI so the proxy can call Alpha Vantage without exposing the key to the browser.
3. Enable **Settings ‚Üí Use Netlify proxy** inside the app; requests will route through `/.netlify/functions/alphavantage` automatically.
4. For local development with functions, run `netlify dev` (requires `npm install -g netlify-cli`).

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 + modern CSS (no frameworks)
- Vanilla ES modules
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) via CDN for visualization
- LocalStorage for persistent state
- Optional Netlify Functions for API key secrecy
- Chart.js Zoom plugin for pan/zoom interactions
- Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit quality gates

## Notes

- Alpha Vantage enforces rate limits (5 calls/min, 500/day). Heavy usage may trigger the mock fallback; wait a minute if you see repeated mock data when using a real key.
- Review the [Alpha Vantage Terms of Service](https://www.alphavantage.co/terms_of_service/) before deploying publicly; respect their rate limits and attribution requirements.
- Technical indicators are calculated locally; signal logic uses a basic SMA crossover and RSI thresholds for illustration purposes.
- All numbers are displayed in the selected currency‚Äîadjust or extend the list of currencies as needed.
- Netlify proxy mode requires the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` environment variable; otherwise the app falls back to client-side fetches or mock data when rate-limited.
- Export charts and data responsibly; CSV/JSON files downloaded from the app may include sensitive portfolio information.

Enjoy building and testing investment strategies!
